## Crowdience 

 

Crowdience is a take on the traditional ‘Mr & Mrs’ game, often played at a wedding.  

  There is: 

+ A **Host**, who controls the game. 

+ A **Couple**, who are the subject of the questions. 

+ **Audience** members, who vote on one member of the couple for each question.

  **How to Use:** 

The game is hosted on Microsoft Azure Services. 

Simply by going onto the home page, you are presented with playing as either the host, part of a couple, or as an audience member.  

Nothing is required to download the game and can be played simply with a device and internet connection.

  **Tech Stack used:**

We had a task to create a C# web app. Starting off with a .Net Core Framework on Visual Studio Code, we found SignalR would enable real-time interaction with multiple users. We used Entity Framework Core as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to enable functions to use our PostgreSQL database.  

|     Front-End   |     Database            |     Back-End   |      Hosting               |
|   -----------   |   -----------           |   -----------  |    -----------             |
|    Javascript   |   Entity Framework Core |   ASP.Net Core |      Docker                |
|    Razor Pages  |    PostgreSQL           |   SignalR      |   Microsoft Azure Services |

 **Our Approach:**  

We wanted a project that had a fine balance beteen a challence, and achievability.
8 days to create an app, which showcased 12 weeks of learning. Within a couple of days we had our idea, but didn't fully know how to implement it.
